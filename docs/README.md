# Index: The Career Velocity Tracker

## Core Concept
Index is like "MacroFactor for Career" application. It is not a To-Do list. It is a "Done" Ledger that calculates the **Velocity (Rate of Change)** of a user's professional value. It has the premium feel of apps such as WHOOP and Opal and the data heavy insights , but for career growth.

## The Problem
Professionals suffer from Recency Bias. They forget their wins. They track hours (input), not leverage (output). It is hard to track progress and measure the impact of your work. THis works as a way to track how productive you are in your work and to ensure you have all the evidence needed to get the leverage in your job to get that recognition you deserve and for companies to better understand the blck hole that can be seen in busywork.

## The Solution
A "Daily Check-in" app where the user speaks (can also upload data, files, etc.) naturally about their day. The AI:
1.  **Transcribes** the audio.
2.  **Retrieves** past related tasks (RAG).
3.  **Calculates** the Delta (Efficiency gain, Automation win, Novelty score) and other metrics.
4.  **Updates** a "Career Velocity" metric and other metrics and stores the data to generate in depth reports for when individual evaluations are needed.
5.  **Secures** the data and stores it in a database so that even the most confidential data is completely safe with world class security.
